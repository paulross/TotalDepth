
Summary of speed tests of low level read and conversion to integer.
===================================================================
Machine DELL laptop dual core with encrypted hard drive.

TestStringIntConvert.py
-----------------------
Takes in-memory strings and converts them to BE/LE integers using three methods.
1. - Python byte stuffing.
2. - Cython byte stuffing.
3. - The struct module.

Cython vs Python
----------------
Cython code read rate is x1.7 for 1 byte words, x2.6 for 4 byte codes.
struct is about xs as fast for 4 bytes as Cython.

Typical figures for 4 byte words:
Python:             2,000 kB/s
Cython:             6,300 kb/s
Struct:            13,800 kb/s 
Struct (compiled): 17,200 kB/s

Looks like struct has it.

Big endian vs Little endian
---------------------------
With Python/Cython LE took 3% to 15% longer than BE.
With the struct module LE is about 0% to 3% faster (not significantly in other words).

Precompilation of struct using struct.Struct()
----------------------------------------------
Precompiling the struct format statement gives a 13-32% speed increase for small
buffers, falls to zero for about 512 byte format string and is actually slower
by about 5% fo a 8192 byte format string.


TestReadSpeed.py
================

Reading binary files and reading and unpacking
----------------------------------------------
For single byte buffers read is arount 1500 kb/s and unpacking the same.
At 32 bytes read is around 90,000 kB/s (!) and unpacking takes the same time
again (i.e. half rate).
Above that read rate continues to increase almost linearly (1GB/s @ 8192 buffer size!)
with read+unpack flattening off at arund 100,000 kB/s

In-memory rates may be around x2 to x3.
